Result skin for beatoraja inspired by BISTROVER's new result screen.

Currently in **very early stages of development**, but already somewhat
useable.

## Features

* hopefully easier-to-parse-than-most-beatoraja-skins result screen
* different types of panes selectable for the left and right side independently
* custom panes where up to 5 modules are selectable and whose layout will be
  generated automatically

Still todo:

* more widgets and pre-defined panes (IR info, detailed song info, etc)
* background images
* lots of things to polish still

## Screenshots

### Custom pane example

There aren't really enough widgets for this to be useful yet but we'll get
there eventually
